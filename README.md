# Buddy
An iOS based application which displays the list of restaurants to eat based on the amount of active calories (from the health data gathered through Apple watch) burnt in the day. 
Also, the user can chose to go and eat alone or find people nearby who are going to the same location at the same time and send a request to hang out with them. 
Implemented the range, knn and fence queries in determining the restaurants.
